I didn't even know that fonts can be categorized into a couple of letterforms, Serif, Sans Serif and Mono(Monospace), until today...
Let's from where I started. A guy's handling a font related issue this morning. 
And I just wanted to figure out how to find which font the browser would fall in when all fonts specified in CSS weren't installed on the client. 
Then I binged [this page](https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/css/fonts-and-formatting/web-browser-font-defaults/) and after navigating to the page above, the table below surfaced:

OS | Browser | Sans-serif |     Serif       | Mono
------ | ------|----------|-----------------|----------
Windows| IE    | Arial    | Times New Roman | Courier New

I was confused by the last three columns which were Sans-serif, Serif and Mono. Familiar, huh? After digging in a little bit. As we already know, those are categories of fonts. 
A Serif Typeface is a font with a small line attached to the end of each stroke. Like Georgia,„ÄÅTimes New Roman.
A Sans-serif Typeface is a font without any line attached to the end of each stroke. From the French sans, meaning "without". Like Arial, Tahoma, Verdana.
A Monospace Typeface, also called a fixed-pitch, fixed-width, or non-proportional font, is a font whose letters and characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space. Like  Courier, Courier New, Lucida Console, Monaco, Consolas and Inconsolata.
